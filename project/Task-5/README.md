# Task 5

We change the data set from the sine function to real-word data-set from the industry. Download the following data-set from kaggle: [**data**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielbacioiu/tig-aluminium-5083?resource=download). You can find more information about the data set in the following [**paper**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1526612519302245?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-2&rr=8af1203cbad98af9).


Implement a Quantum Machine Learning model to detect a defective production part. The implementation includes the preprocessing of the data, the implementation of a model and the visualization of the results. You can use one of the models above. Further, you can also use only a subset of the downloaded data. The final deliverable should be a notebook in which all the necessary steps have been carried out and documented.
