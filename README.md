# Womanium coding Assignments for the 2024 cohort

## QBronze - Basics
QBronze is the basic module for Quantum algorithms and delas with basic arithmetic s=following quantum theory. Here's a breakdown of the quizzes :- 

## QNickel - Algorithms
QNickel is about basic Quantum algortihms namely Simon's algorithm, Deutsch-Josza algorithm , Grover's algorithm and it's use case for solving adder quantum circuits and solving MaxCut problems using Grover's algorithm which gives us the probability for 2 coloring graphs and the ways to generate unique points at the end of edges.

## QCobalt - Annealing
Using DWave's Ocean SDK in this module we solve Quadratic problems for optimization. The formulation of the same are enlisted in these exercise.
