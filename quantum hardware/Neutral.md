### Neutral-Atom Quantum Hardware:

* How is quantum information encoded in a neutral-atom qubit, i.e. what constitutes the two-level system with defined states  |0⟩  and  |1⟩?
  * Internal energy state of the atoms 

* How to initialize the neutral-atom qubit?
  * Using lasers to drive the atom to the desired initial state 
  
* How can we improve the coherence time of neutral-atom qubits?
  * Reducing external sources of noise, for example, laser phase noise 

* How can we implement gates using neutral-atom qubits? (Hint: in classical computing we switch between 0 and 1 in a controlled way)
  * Exciting the atoms from one internal energy state to another 
 
* Which fundamental atomic interaction is used to implement two qubit gates for neutral-atom quantum computing?
  * Dipole-Dipole interaction between Rydberg atoms 
  
* How do we differentiate between the qubit states for measurement?
  * Detecting light emitted from the atoms when probed with a laser beam 

* What are the most common sources of errors in neutral-atom quantum computing?
  * State preparation errors 
  * Dephasing of the Rydberg state 
  * State detection errors 

* What is a unique feature of quantum computers based on cold atoms?
  * They can perform digital and analog quantum computing.
 
* What are the main limitations in scaling neutral-atom quantum computers?
  * Laser power and uniform atomic array generation for large devices.

* State an advantage and a disadvantage of neutral atoms as a quantum computing platform. 
  * Advantages: They are all identical to one another and are simultaneously capable of storing and processing quantum information. This uniformity gives them an edge over manufactured qubits, which can suffer from imperfections.
  * Disadvantages: The gate operations are slower than in superconducting qubits. This is because physical qubit movement (qubit shuttling) is involved both in the initial setup of the system as well as in moving qubits near each other so that they can be entangled.
