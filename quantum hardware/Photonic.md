### Photonic Quantum Hardware:

1. How is quantum information encoded in a photonic qubit, i.e. what constitutes the two-level system with defined states  |0⟩  and  |1⟩ ?
  * The information is encoded into two orthogonal grid-states in the phase space of light. 

2. How to initialize the photonic qubit?[wrong]
 
3. How can we improve the coherence time of photonic qubits?
  * By decreasing phase noise in the system. 
 
4. How can we implement gates using photonic qubits? (Hint: in classical computing we switch between 0 and 1 in a controlled way)
  * Measurement-induced teleportation in a cluster state. 

5. How do we create two-qubit gates use entanglement?
  * Measurement-induced teleportation in a cluster state. 

6. How do we differentiate between the qubit states for measurement?
  * Measuring one of the quadratures of the light.

7. What are the most common sources of errors in photonic quantum computing? [wrong]

8. How is squeezed light generated?
  * Via nonlinear interactions with polarizable media. 

9. What is the advantage to using GKP-based cluster-state computing compared to fusion-based cluster-state computing? [wrong]

10. State an advantage and a disadvantage of photons as a quantum computing platform.
  * Advantages: All-to-all connectivity; Photonic waveguides are relatively large and easy to fabricate.
  * Disadvantage: Tolerance to detector imperfections is low; Number of qubits in a single chip is very limited; Uses non-standard computation method (one-way quantum computing).
