### Quantum Annealing:

* What is quantum annealing?
  * A quantum algorithm that utilizes the adiabatic theorem and has applications in optimization 

* What kind of qubits does D-Wave use?
  * Superconducting flux qubits 

* How do we formulate real-world problems to solve on D-Waveâ€™s quantum computers?
  * Build a BQM by defining the variables and then combining an objective and constraints.
